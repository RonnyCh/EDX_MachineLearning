## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.







Chapter 31 Case study: Election forecasting

In a previous section, we generated these data tables:

```{r}
polls <- polls_us_election_2016 %>% 
  filter(state == "U.S." & enddate >= "2016-10-31" &
           (grade %in% c("A+","A","A-","B+") | is.na(grade))) %>% 
  mutate(spread = rawpoll_clinton/100 - rawpoll_trump/100)

one_poll_per_pollster <- polls %>% group_by(pollster) %>% 
  filter(enddate == max(enddate)) %>%
  ungroup()

results <- one_poll_per_pollster %>% 
  summarize(avg = mean(spread), se = sd(spread)/sqrt(length(spread))) %>% 
  mutate(start = avg - 1.96*se, end = avg + 1.96*se) 
```

Below, we will use these for our forecasting.

31.1 Bayesian approach

Pollsters tend to make probabilistic statements about the results of the election. For example, “The chance that Obama wins the electoral colleges is 91%” is a probabilistic statement about the parameter  
d
 . We showed that for the 2016 election, FiveThirtyEight gave Clinton a 81.4% chance of winning the popular vote. To do this, they used the Bayesian approach we described.

We assume a hierarchical model similar to what we did to predict the performance of a baseball player. Statistical textbooks will write the model like this:
